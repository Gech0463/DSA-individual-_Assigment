   Bubble Sort in C++

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C++ along with execution time measurement.

The program sorts a list of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and measures the time it takes to perform the sorting. It prints both the sorted array and the time taken in seconds.

      Features
- Implements basic Bubble Sort algorithm
- Measures execution time using `clock()`
- Prints the sorted array
- Simple and easy-to-understand C++ code

   Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- C++11 or later (recommended for better features like `auto` and `vector`)
 Build Instructions

To compile the code, use a terminal and run:

```bash
g++ -o bubble_sort bubble_sort.cpp
