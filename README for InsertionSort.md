 Insertion Sort in C++

This project demonstrates an implementation of the INSERTION Sort algorithm in C++ and measures its execution timE.

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time.
 It is best suited for small or partially sorted datasets.

     This program:
- Sorts a sample array using Insertion Sort
- Measures and displays the execution time
- Outputs the sorted array
     Features
- Clear and simple implementation
- Uses `vector` for dynamic arrays
- Uses `clock()` to time the sort
- Outputs both sorted result and time taken
  Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- C++11 or later

   How to Compile

Open your terminal and compile with:

```bash
g++ -o insertion_sort insertion_sort.cpp
