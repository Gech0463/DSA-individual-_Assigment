    Selection Sort in C++
    Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It divides the input array into two parts: a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted subarray and moves it to the sorted subarray.
This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates the Selection Sort algorithm and measures its execution time.
- The program sorts an array of integers using Selection Sort.
- It also measures how long the sorting process takes using `clock()` from `<ctime>`.
   Time Complexity

- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Best Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)
 Space Complexity
- O(1) (In-place sorting)
