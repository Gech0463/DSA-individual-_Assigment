1. Find the Smallest Number in an Array (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that finds and prints the  smallest number in a given array of integers.

The program uses a function `findSmallest()` to loop through the array and determine the smallest value. The array is hardcoded, but you can easily modify it to take user input if needed.
HOW IT WORKS
- Initializes an array with a set of integers.
- Calculates the array size.
- Calls the `findSmallest()` function.
- Prints the smallest value found in the array.
 FEATURES
- Finds the smallest number in an array.
- Demonstrates basic use of arrays, loops, and functions in C++.
How to Run

1. Save the code** into a file, for example: `find_smallest.cpp`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o find_smallest find_smallest.cpp
