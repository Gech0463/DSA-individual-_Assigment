 Second and Third Largest Elements in an Array (C++)

This C++ program identifies the second and third largest unique elements in a given array of integers. It is a simple and efficient demonstration of array traversal and conditional logic using `INT_MIN` as placeholders.

 Features

- Finds the first, second, and third largest elements in a single pass.
- Ignores duplicate values to ensure uniqueness.
- Written with readability and performance in mind.

 How It Works

   The function `findSecondAndThirdLargest()`:
1. Initializes three variables `firstLargest`, `secondLargest`, and `thirdLargest` to `INT_MIN`.
2. Traverses the array once to update these values based on conditions.
3. Ensures all three values are distinct.
